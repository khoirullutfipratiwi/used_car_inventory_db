# Used Car Inventory Database

Building a database for a project or application and understanding data retrieval processes is a core task in Software & Data Engineering. This project aims to construct a relational database for a website that offers used car sales. The website will showcase products (used cars) in the form of advertisements, allowing potential buyers to search based on various categories.

## Features and Limitations
1. Users can list multiple used cars for sale.
2. Before listing a car, users must provide their personal details, including name, contact information, and location.
3. Users will list their cars through advertisements on the website.
4. Each listing will include a title, detailed vehicle information, and the seller's contact details.
5. Required listing information includes:
    - Brand: Toyota, Daihatsu, Honda, etc.
    - Model: Toyota Camry, Toyota Corolla Altis, Toyota Vios, Toyota Camry Hybrid, etc.
    - Body style: MPV, SUV, Van, Sedan, Hatchback, etc.
    - Transmission: manual or automatic
    - Year: 2005, 2010, 2011, 2020
6. Users can search for cars based on location, make, and body style.
7. If a buyer is interested, they can make an offer on the car if the seller has enabled the bidding feature.
8. The actual transaction will occur outside of the application and is not within the scope of this project.

## Outcome
The project output is a relational database designed to meet the specified features and constraints. The database design process involves defining a mission statement, creating table structures, determining table relationships, identifying business rules, and implementing a relational database. Subsequently, dummy datasets will be generated for each table and queries will be executed to analyze various aspects of the database. These queries will include both transactional and analytical queries.
